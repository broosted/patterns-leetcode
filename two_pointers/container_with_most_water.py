    Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
    n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
    Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
    
    Example:
    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The maximum area is obtained by choosing height[1] = 8 and height[8] = 7
